 Microsoft Stock Market Prediction Using Time Seris, RNN and LSTM

This Jupyter Notebook presents a comprehensive analysis and prediction of Microsoft's stock prices from March 14, 2005, to August 2, 2024. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, particularly Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, this notebook aims to forecast future stock prices based on historical data.
 
  Objectives:
1. Data Exploration: Understanding the historical stock price data and identifying key trends and patterns.
2. Data Preprocessing: Preparing the data for input into the RNN and LSTM models by normalizing, splitting into training and testing sets, and reshaping.
3. Model Development: Building and training RNN and LSTM models to predict Microsoftâ€™s stock prices.
4. Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models using various metrics and visualizations.
5. Prediction: Using the trained models to predict future stock prices and analyze the outcomes.
